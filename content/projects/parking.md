Featured on Fortune magazine and NVIDIA Developer News, our project optimises for the minimal number of video frames required for accurate parking utilisation measurements. This enables large-scale quantification of parking usage for urban planning purposes. Our results are published in the IEEE Internet of Things Journal.
