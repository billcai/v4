- Applied novel algorithms to minimise sampling rate and processing requirements for large-scale parking utilisation. Project was published on IEEE Internet of Things journal, and featured on Fortune magazine and NVIDIA developer news.
- Data mining, deep learning and computer vision models training, and large-scale deployment to quantify urban canopy cover. Project was featured on Wall Street Journal, Time, and Wired, and inspired cities of Paris, Singapore and London to launch their municipal greenery measurement efforts.
- Sensor-fusion of lidar and camera data for obstacle detection in autonomous marine vehicle applications in Amsterdam and Boston/Cambridge - our Roboat project is famous! Featured on CNN, Forbes and CNBC.
- Implemented state-of-the-art CNN architectures for classification, semantic segmentation and instance segmentation, including residual network, Mask-RCNN, PSPNet. Utilized gradient class activation (Grad-CAM) maps to understand learned features.
- Extensive use of ROS, including Google Cartographer for SLAM, Velodyne lidar, IMU, USB cameras, for sponsored project by SNCF in Paris
- Collaboration with interdisciplinary team of software engineers, ecologists, urban studies experts.
