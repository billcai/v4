Hello! I'm Bill, a ML researcher/practitioner based in Singapore. I lived in Chicago, Boston, and the Bay Area for 5 years before moving back to Singapore in 2019.

I enjoy building machine learning algorithms and systems that have a real-world impact on people's lives. My goal is to build end-to-end ML products and solutions that engineers enjoy working on, and have positive outcomes for society.

After graduating from the research-based master's program from [MIT's Center for Computational Engineering](http://cce.mit.edu/), I joined the data science team at [One Concern](https://www.oneconcern.com) to build large-scale computer vision and network modelling systems to estimate impacts of natural disasters. I worked at [Govtech Singapore](https://www.tech.gov.sg) for 3 years where my team and I built a cloud-based image and video analytics platform. Now, I am at [Amazon Web Services ML Solutions Lab](https://aws.amazon.com/ml-solutions-lab/) designing and building ML solutions for customers across the APAC region.

Here's what I've been up to lately:
