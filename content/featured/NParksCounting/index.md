Working closely with stakeholders in National Parks Board, my team and I developed a cloud-based crowd estimation system. By connecting over 180 cameras nationwide to our AI-enabled people counting backend, we were able to reduce and optimise the heavy operational requirements for NParks to deploy their offices to ensure park safety, and also provided members of the public with useful real-time data to self-manage their own itineraries. This event-driven system was delivered in an iterative approach, scaling quickly from our initial pilot of 5 to 100+ cameras within 3 months. Our project was featured on national media and also in ArcGIS featured talks.
