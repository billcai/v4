Working closely with stakeholders in National Parks Board, my team and I developed a cloud-based crowd estimation system. By connecting over 180 cameras nationwide to our AI-enabled people counting backend, we were able to reduce and optimise the heavy operational requirements for NParks to deploy their offices to ensure park safety, and also provided members of the public with useful real-time data to self-manage their own itineraries. This event-driven system was delivered in an iterative approach, scaling quickly from our initial pilot of 5 to 100+ cameras within 3 months. The public-facing website receives over 450k-800k monthly visits since 2020, with the project receiving media coverage by Singapore primetime news.
