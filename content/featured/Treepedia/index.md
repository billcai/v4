Treepedia measures the canopy cover in cities. We've developed a scalable and universally applicable method by analyzing the amount of green perceived while walking down the street. The visualization maps street-level perception only, so your favorite parks aren't included. Our work has been featured on popular news outlets such as Wall Street Journal, The Guardian, Forbes and Wired. Our Treepedia 2.0 paper is accepted at the IEEE BigData Congress 2018, and we explore our deep learning application in the area of climate change in a NeurIPS 2019 Climate Change workshop paper.
