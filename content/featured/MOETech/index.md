I led a collaboration project with Singapore's Ministry of Education to implement and benchmark LLMs, and evaluate open-ended language tasks to create solutions to assist educators and expand student access to feedback. This led to a successful implementation on AWS, and also a research paper that has been accepted to NAACL 2024. Also made open-source contributions to popular LLM benchmark library [Alpaca-Eval](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval).
