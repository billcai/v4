I led a collaboration project with Singapore's Government Technology Agency to integrate generative AI capabilities into GovTech's ML/AI platform called MAESTRO. Through the project, we collaborated on inference optimizations for large language models, achieving 75% cost reduction in inference costs with no significant decrease in quality benchmarks. Public sector users develop on the platform to enable diverse and impactful use cases; for example, CPF Board is using the platform for call transcript summarization for over 600,000 call transcripts per year and Ministry of Manpower developed a LLM-powered sensemaking tool to process over 1 million documents and save over 2,000 work hours annually.
