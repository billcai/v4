I led the engineering efforts to integrate LLMs for regional languages in SageMaker Jumpstart. This includes SEA-LION, a 3B-7B model trained on Southeast Asian languages. These include making changes to popular optimized LLM inference libraries like [Text Generation Inference](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference).
