I led the science and research work to enable immersive storytelling with LLMs and diffusion models. I worked on decreasing overall latency from 5 mins to under 30 seconds, measuring and enhancing art style and character consistency, and reducing occurences of undesirable content. The immersive storytelling was an overwhelming success for National Libray Board, resulting in nationwide news coverage and repeated extensions of the project and display.
